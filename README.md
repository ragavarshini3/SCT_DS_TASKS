#TASK_01
The tasks are:

Creating a Bar Chart or Histogram: Visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as ages or genders in a population.

Building a Decision Tree Classifier: Predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data using a dataset like the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Objective

To create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

Steps

Load the dataset.

Select a categorical or continuous variable (e.g., age or gender).

Use Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to create the bar chart or histogram.

#TASK_03 

Objective

Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service.

Dataset

Use the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or a similar dataset.

Steps

Load the dataset.

Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables).

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train a decision tree classifier using scikit-learn.

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Requirements

Install the following Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

#TASK_04
# Traffic Accident Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. It also visualizes accident hotspots and contributing factors.

## Dataset
- **File:** `accident dataset task_4.csv`
- **Columns:** Includes timestamp, weather, latitude, longitude, severity, and other relevant attributes.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values
  - Converting timestamp to readable formats (hour, day of the week)
- **Visualizations:**
  - Accident count by hour of the day
  - Accidents by weather conditions
  - Accident hotspots (latitude & longitude scatter plot)
  - Correlation heatmap between various factors
  - Accidents by day of the week
  - Accidents by severity level

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Install dependencies using `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`.
2. Run the script to analyze and visualize the data.
3. Review the generated charts for insights.

## Output
- Graphs and charts illustrating accident trends, hotspots, and contributing factors.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement machine learning models for accident severity prediction.
- Enhance geographical visualization using interactive maps.
