##TASK_02
## Titanic Dataset

## Overview
The **Titanic Dataset** is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning and is often used for binary classification problems, such as predicting passenger survival based on various features.

## Dataset Source
The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and was originally derived from real passenger data from the Titanic disaster of 1912.

## Data Description
The dataset contains information about passengers, including demographics and ticket details, with the target variable (`Survived`) indicating whether a passenger survived (`1`) or not (`0`).

### Features:
- `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger
- `Survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- `Name`: Passenger's full name
- `Sex`: Gender (male/female)
- `Age`: Age in years
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
- `Ticket`: Ticket number
- `Fare`: Passenger fare
- `Cabin`: Cabin number (if available)
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Usage
The dataset is primarily used for **classification models**, predicting survival probability based on given features.

### Example Usage in Python
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("titanic.csv")

# Display first few rows
print(df.head())
```

## Applications
- **Survival Prediction**: Building machine learning models to predict passenger survival.
- **Data Visualization**: Exploring correlations between factors like class, gender, and survival.
- **Feature Engineering**: Understanding the impact of different variables on survival rates.

## License
The dataset is publicly available for research and educational purposes.

##TASK_03
# Bank Marketing Dataset

## Overview
The **Bank Marketing Dataset** contains data related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The dataset is widely used for classification problems, such as predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

## Dataset Source
The dataset originates from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)

## Data Description
The dataset consists of **inputs related to client demographics, campaign information, and economic indicators**. The target variable (`y`) represents whether the client subscribed (`yes`) or not (`no`) to a term deposit.

### Features:
- `age`: Age of the client (numeric)
- `job`: Type of job (categorical)
- `marital`: Marital status (categorical)
- `education`: Education level (categorical)
- `default`: Has credit in default? (categorical: 'yes', 'no')
- `balance`: Account balance (numeric)
- `housing`: Has a housing loan? ('yes', 'no')
- `loan`: Has a personal loan? ('yes', 'no')
- `contact`: Contact communication type (categorical)
- `day`: Last contact day of the month (numeric)
- `month`: Last contact month of the year (categorical)
- `duration`: Last contact duration in seconds (numeric)
- `campaign`: Number of contacts performed during this campaign (numeric)
- `pdays`: Number of days since last contact (-1 means never contacted)
- `previous`: Number of contacts performed before this campaign (numeric)
- `poutcome`: Outcome of the previous campaign (categorical)
- `y`: Target variable (binary: 'yes' or 'no')

## Usage
This dataset is commonly used for **classification problems**, where the goal is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

### Example Usage in Python
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("bank.csv", delimiter=';')

# Display first few rows
print(df.head())
```

## Applications
- **Customer Targeting**: Identify potential customers for term deposits.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Build models to predict customer response.
- **Marketing Strategy Optimization**: Analyze the effectiveness of different marketing channels.

- **Visualizations:**
  - Accident count by hour of the day
  - Accidents by weather conditions
  - Accident hotspots (latitude & longitude scatter plot)
  - Correlation heatmap between various factors
  - Accidents by day of the week
  - Accidents by severity level

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
